Which of the following programs is this pseudocode for?
C. MidpointFinderKarel.java


Your Pseudocode:
This methodology for finding the midpoint is best described as a "squeeze" method
in which Karel decrements the distance between two beepers until Karel hones in on
the midpoint.

place beeper for left boundary
while able to move forward without hitting a wall:
	keep moving
place beeper for right boundary and turn around
while able to move forward:
	keep moving
	if there is a beeper under Karel:
		pick up the beeper
		turn around
		place beeper one space closer to center
turn around because Karel is at a wall facing outward
move until Karel finds the extraneous beeper
pick up beeper
move to midpoint beeper
