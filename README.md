# CS106A
These projects are all completed assignments from my CS 106A Java Programming Methodology class at Stanford, which I took in the summer of 2019.
All source code in this repository were edited and tested in Eclipse on Java SE 8. If not written by me, the files were given
to me by Stanford University as part of the starter code. Regardless of the origin of the file, any source code used from this repository in order to complete assignments for a future section of CS106A will be in violation of the Stanford University Honor Code.
